# Computer and Network Security (CS529)

## Abstract

In this report, we will explore discrete log-based elliptic curve cryptography. We first examine the elliptic curve over finite fields and different cryptosystems build upon them.
Then we will examine the discrete log problem on these curves and algorithms that attempt to solve it.
We will also be implementing attacks where these algorithms can potentially lead to partial or total break of the cryptosystem.
